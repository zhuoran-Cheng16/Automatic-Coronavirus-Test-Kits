## Automatic-Coronavirus-Test-Kits
# Use different deep-learning method to improve the performance of the coronavirus test kit in terms of recall and precision. 
  Use different classifiers included ExtraTrees, MLP, SVC, kNeighbors, RandomForest, soft-voting to get best hyper parameters that training more than 4000 samples that achieve 100% recall and more than 70% of precision.
